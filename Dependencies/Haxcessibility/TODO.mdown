# To-do

- HAXWindow
	- window elements should subclass a general widget class of some description
	- animate size/position/frame changes?
		- Maybe something like the NSWindow -setFrame:animate: method for that.

- Overall
	- wrap AXAPIEnabled/AXIsProcessTrusted
	- handle AX trust authorization
		- getting auth
		- setting the trust bit or whatever
		- relaunching the app at the clientâ€™s request (so they can in turn ask the user, if they deem it necessary)
